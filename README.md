Dancer2 is the evolution of [Dancer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer)
and is based on on [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo), a lightweight
object framework for Perl.

Dancer2 can optionally use XS modules for speed, but at its core remains
fatpackable (via [App::FatPacker](https://metacpan.org/pod/App%3A%3AFatPacker)), allowing
you to easily deploy Dancer2 applications in environments that do not support custom
installations of CPAN modules.

Dancer2 is easy and fun:

    use Dancer2;
    get '/' => sub { "Hello World" };
    dance;
