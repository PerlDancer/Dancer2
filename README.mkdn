# NAME

Dancer2 - Lightweight yet powerful web application framework

# VERSION

version 0.160000

# DESCRIPTION

Dancer2 is the new generation of [Dancer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer), the lightweight web-framework for
Perl. Dancer2 is a complete rewrite based on [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo).

Dancer2 can optionally use XS modules for speed, but at its core remains
fatpackable (packable by [App::FatPacker](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::FatPacker)) so you could easily deploy Dancer2
applications on hosts that do not support custom CPAN modules.

Dancer2 is easy and fun:

    use Dancer2;
    get '/' => sub { "Hello World" };
    dance;

This is the main module for the Dancer2 distribution. It contains logic for
creating a new Dancer2 application.

## Documentation Index

Documentation on Dancer2 is split into several manpages. Below is a
complete outline on where to go for help.

- Dancer2 Tutorial

    If you are new to the Dancer approach, you should start by reading
    our [Dancer2::Tutorial](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Tutorial).

- Dancer2 Manual

    [Dancer2::Manual](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Manual) is the reference for Dancer2. Here you will find
    information on the concepts of Dancer2 application development and
    a comprehensive reference to the Dancer2 domain specific
    language.

- Dancer2 Keywords

    The keywords for Dancer2 can be found under [DSL Keywords](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Manual#DSL-KEYWORDS).

- Dancer2 Deployment

    For configuration examples of different deployment solutions involving
    Dancer2 and Plack, refer to [Dancer2::Manual::Deployment](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Manual::Deployment).

- Dancer2 Cookbook

    Specific examples of code for real-life problems and some 'tricks' for
    applications in Dancer can be found in [Dancer2::Cookbook](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Cookbook)

- Dancer2 Config

    For configuration file details refer to [Dancer2::Config](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Config). It is a
    complete list of all configuration options.

- Dancer2 Plugins

    Refer to [Dancer2::Plugins](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Plugins) for a partial list of available Dancer2
    plugins. Note that although we try to keep this list up to date we
    expect plugin authors to tell us about new modules.

- Dancer2 Migration guide

    [Dancer2::Manual::Migration](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Manual::Migration) provides the most up-to-date instruction on
    how to convert a Dancer (1) based application to Dancer2.

# METHODS

## import;

If it doesn't exist already, `import` creates a new runner, imports strict
and warnings, loads additional libraries, creates a new Dancer2 app (of type
[Dancer2::Core::App](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Core::App)) and exports the DSL symbols to the caller.

If any additional argument processing is needed, it will be done at this point.

Import gets called when you use Dancer2. You can specify import options giving
you control over the keywords that will be imported into your webapp and other
things:

    use Dancer2 '!quux'; # Don't import DSL keyword quux
    use Dancer2 appname => 'MyAwesomeApp'; # Add routes and hooks to MyAwesomeApp
    use Dancer2 ( foo => 'bar' ); # sets option foo to bar (currently not implemented)

# FUNCTIONS

## my $runner=runner();

Returns the current runner. It is of type [Dancer2::Core::Runner](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Core::Runner).
