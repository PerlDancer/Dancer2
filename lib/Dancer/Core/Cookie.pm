=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dancer::Core::Cookie;

    my $cookie = Dancer::Cookie->new(
        name => $cookie_name, value => $cookie_value
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dancer::Cookie provides a HTTP cookie object to work with cookies.

=method my $cookie=new Dancer::Cookie (%opts);

Create a new Dancer::Cookie object.

You can set any attribute described in the I<ATTRIBUTES> section above.

=method my $header=$cookie->to_header();

Creates a proper HTTP cookie header from the content.

=cut

sub to_header {
    my $self   = shift;
    my $header = '';

    my $value       = join('&', map { uri_escape($_) } $self->value);
    my $no_httponly = defined( $self->http_only ) && $self->http_only == 0;

    my @headers = $self->name . '=' . $value;
    push @headers, "path=" . $self->path || '/';
    push @headers, "expires=" . $self->expires  if $self->expires;
    push @headers, "domain=" . $self->domain    if $self->domain;
    push @headers, "Secure"                     if $self->secure;
    push @headers, 'HttpOnly'                   unless $no_httponly;

    return join '; ', @headers;
}



=attr value

The cookie's value.

=cut 

has value => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => ArrayRef,
    required => 0,
    coerce   => sub {
        my $value = shift;
        my @values =
            ref $value eq 'ARRAY' ? @$value
          : ref $value eq 'HASH'  ? %$value
          :                         ($value);
        return [@values];
    },
);

around value => sub {
    my $orig = shift;
    my $self = shift;
    my $array = $orig->($self, @_);
    return wantarray ? @$array : $array->[0];
};

=attr name

The cookie's name.

=cut

has name => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => Str,
    required => 1,
);



=attr expires

The cookie's expiration date.  There are several formats.

Unix epoch time like 1288817656 to mean "Wed, 03-Nov-2010 20:54:16 GMT"

A human readable offset from the current time such as "2 hours".  It currently
understands...

    s second seconds sec secs
    m minute minutes min mins
    h hr hour hours
    d day days
    w week weeks
    M month months
    y year years

Months and years are currently fixed at 30 and 365 days.  This may change.

Anything else is used verbatim.

=cut

has expires => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => Str,
    required => 0,
    coerce   => sub {
       my $time = shift;
        # First, normalize things like +2h to # of seconds
        $time = _parse_duration($time) if $time !~ /^\d+$/;

        # Then translate to a gmt string, if it isn't one already
        $time = _epoch_to_gmtstring($time) if $time =~ /^\d+$/;

        return $time;
    },
);


=attr domain

The cookie's domain.

=cut

has domain => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => Str,
    required => 0,
);

=attr path

The cookie's path.

=cut

has path => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => Str,
    predicate => 1,
);

=attr secure

If true, it instructs the client to only serve the cookie over secure
connections such as https.

=cut

has secure => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => Bool,
    required => 0,
    default  => sub { 0 },
);

=attr http_only

By default, cookies are created with a property, named C<HttpOnly>,
that can be used for security, forcing the cookie to be used only by
the server (via HTTP) and not by any JavaScript code.

If your cookie is meant to be used by some JavaScript code, set this
attribute to 0.

=cut

has http_only => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => Bool,
    required => 0,
    default  => sub { 0 },
);
