=head1 NAME

Dancer::Session::YAML - YAML-file-based session backend for Dancer

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a session engine based on YAML files. Session are stored
in a I<session_dir> as YAML files. The idea behind this module was to provide a
transparent session storage for the developer.

This backend is intended to be used in development environments, when looking
inside a session can be useful.

It's not recommended to use this session engine in production environments.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The setting B<session> should be set to C<YAML> in order to use this session
engine in a Dancer application.

Files will be stored to the value of the setting C<session_dir>, whose default
value is C<appdir/sessions>.

Here is an example configuration that use this session engine and stores session
files in /tmp/dancer-sessions

    session: "YAML"
    session_dir: "/tmp/dancer-sessions"

=head1 METHODS

=head2 reset

to avoid checking if the sessions directory exists everytime a new session is
created, this module maintains a cache of session directories it has already
created. C<reset> wipes this cache out, forcing a test for existence
of the sessions directory next time a session is created. It takes no argument.

This is particulary useful if you want to remove the sessions directory on the
system where your app is running, but you want this session engine to continue
to work without having to restart your application.

=head1 DEPENDENCY

This module depends on L<YAML>.

=head1 AUTHOR

This module has been written by Alexis Sukrieh, see the AUTHORS file for
