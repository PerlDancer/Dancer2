=head1 SYNOPSIS

This template engine allows you to use L<Template::Tiny> in L<Dancer>.

L<Template::Tiny> is an implementation of a subset of L<Template::Toolkit> (the
major parts) which takes much less memory and is faster. If you're only using
the main functions of Template::Toolkit, you could use Template::Tiny. You can
also seemlessly move back to Template::Toolkit whenever you want.

However, Dancer uses a modified version of L<Template::Tiny>, which is L<Dancer::Template::Implementation::ForkedTiny>. It adds 2 features :

=over

=item *

opening and closing tag are now configurable

=item *

CodeRefs are evaluated and their results is inserted in the result.

=back

You can read more on L<Dancer::Template::Implementation::ForkedTiny>.

To use this engine, all you need to configure in your L<Dancer>'s
C<config.yaml>:

    template: "tiny"

Of course, you can also set this B<while> working using C<set>:

    # code code code
    set template => 'tiny';

Since L<Dancer> has internal support for a wrapper-like option with the
C<layout> configuration option, you can have a L<Template::Toolkit>-like WRAPPER
even though L<Template::Tiny> doesn't really support it. :)

Renders the template. Accepts a string to a file or a reference to a string of
the template.
