=head1 SYNOPSIS

This template engine allows you to use L<Template::Tiny> in L<Dancer2>.

L<Template::Tiny> is an implementation of a subset of L<Template::Toolkit> (the
major parts) but takes much less memory and is faster. If you're only using
the main functions of Template::Toolkit, you could use Template::Tiny. You can
also seamlessly move back to Template::Toolkit whenever you want.

Dancer2 maintained a fork of L<Template::Tiny> for some time that added
several features missing in the original module. These have since been
implemented, and as such, a minimum L<Template::Tiny> version of 1.16 is
required.

To use this engine, all you need to configure in your L<Dancer2>'s
C<config.yaml>:

    template: "tiny"

Of course, you can also set this B<while> working using C<set>:

    # code code code
    set template => 'tiny';

Since L<Dancer2> has internal support for a wrapper-like option with the
C<layout> configuration option, you can have a L<Template::Toolkit>-like WRAPPER
even though L<Template::Tiny> doesn't really support it.

=method render($template, \%tokens)

Renders the template.  The first arg is a filename for the template file
or a reference to a string that contains the template.  The second arg
is a hashref for the tokens that you wish to pass to
L<Template::Toolkit> for rendering.
