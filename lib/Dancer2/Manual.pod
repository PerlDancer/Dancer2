# ABSTRACT: A gentle introduction to Dancer2
package Dancer2::Manual;

=encoding utf8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dancer2 is a free and open source micro web application framework written in
Perl.

It's a complete rewrite of L<Dancer> based on L<Moo>.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Installing Dancer2 is simple. If you want to develop Dancer2 webapps from 
scratch, we recommend that you install both L<Dancer2> and the scaffolding 
app L<App::Dancer2> which lets you create new Dancer2 scripts easily:
    
    cpanm Dancer2 App::Dancer2

If you just want to run a Dancer2 webapp on your server, you only need Dancer2,
of course.

There are plenty of other ways to install Dancer2. Here are some worth knowing 
about:

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install Dancer2'

Thanks to the magic of cpanminus, if you do not have CPAN.pm configured, or just
want a quickfire way to get running, the following should work, at least on
Unix-like systems:

    wget -O - http://cpanmin.us | sudo perl - Dancer2

(If you don't have root access, omit the 'sudo', and cpanminus will install
Dancer2 and prereqs into C<~/perl5>.)

=head1 BOOTSTRAPING

Create a web application using the scaffolding script L<App::Dancer2>:

    dancer2 -app MyApp && cd MyApp

And voilà! You can now run the web application:

    bin/app.pl

View the web application at:

    http://localhost:3000

Note that as Dancer2 supports the L<PSGI> specification, you can also use the C<plackup> tool 
(provided by L<Plack>) for launching the application:

    plackup ./bin/app.pl -p 5000

=head1 USAGE

When Dancer2 is imported to a script, that script becomes a webapp, and at this
point, all the script has to do is declare a list of B<routes>.  A route
handler is composed by an HTTP method, a path pattern and a code block.
C<strict> and C<warnings> pragmas are also imported with Dancer2.

The code block given to the route handler has to return a string which will be
used as the content to render to the client.

Routes are defined for a given HTTP method. For each method
supported, a keyword is exported by the module.

The following is an example of a route definition. The route is defined for the
method 'get', so only GET requests will be honoured by that route:

    get '/hello/:name' => sub {
        # do something

        return "Hello ".param('name');
    };


=head2 HTTP METHODS

Here are some of the standard HTTP methods which you can use to define your
route handlers.

=over 8

=item B<GET>        The GET method retrieves information (when defining a route
                    handler for the GET method, Dancer2 automatically defines a
                    route handler for the HEAD method, in order to honour HEAD
                    requests for each of your GET route handlers).
                    To define a GET action, use the B<get> keyword.

=item B<POST>       The POST method is used to create a resource on the
                    server.
                    To define a POST action, use the B<post> keyword.

=item B<PUT>        The PUT method is used to update an existing resource.
                    To define a PUT action, use the B<put> keyword.

=item B<DELETE>     The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete
                    the resource identified by the Request-URI.
                    To define a DELETE action, use the B<del> keyword.

=back

To define a route for multiple methods you can also use the special keyword
B<any>. This example illustrates how to define a route for both GET and
POST methods:

    any ['get', 'post'] => '/myaction' => sub {
        # code
    };

Or even, a route handler that would match any HTTP methods:

    any '/myaction' => sub {
        # code
    };


=head2 ROUTE HANDLERS

The route action is the code reference declared. It can access parameters
through the `params' keyword, which returns a hashref.
This hashref is a merge of the route pattern matches and the request params.

You can have more details about how params are built and how to access them in
the L<Dancer2::Request> documentation.

=head2 NAMED MATCHING

A route pattern can contain one or more tokens (a word prefixed with ':'). Each
token found in a route pattern is used as a named-pattern match. Any match will
be set in the params hashref.


    get '/hello/:name' => sub {
        "Hey ".param('name').", welcome here!";
    };

Tokens can be optional, for example:

    get '/hello/:name?' => sub {
        "Hello there " . param('name') || "whoever you are!";
    };


=head2 WILDCARDS MATCHING

A route can contain a wildcard (represented by a '*'). Each wildcard match will
be returned in an arrayref, accessible via the `splat' keyword.

    get '/download/*.*' => sub {
        my ($file, $ext) = splat;
        # do something with $file.$ext here
    };

=head2 REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING

A route can be defined with a Perl regular expression.

In order to tell Dancer2 to consider the route as a real regexp, the route must
be defined explicitly with C<qr{}>, like the following:

    get qr{/hello/([\w]+)} => sub {
        my ($name) = splat;
        return "Hello $name";
    };

=head2 CONDITIONAL MATCHING

Routes may include some matching conditions (on the useragent and the hostname
at the moment):

    get '/foo', {agent => 'Songbird (\d\.\d)[\d\/]*?'} => sub {
      'foo method for songbird'
    }

    get '/foo' => sub {
      'all browsers except songbird'
    }

=head2 PREFIX

A prefix can be defined for each route handler, like this:

    prefix '/home';

From here, any route handler is defined to /home/*

    get '/page1' => sub {}; # will match '/home/page1'

You can unset the prefix value

    prefix '/'; # or: prefix undef;
    get '/page1' => sub {}; will match /page1

Alternatively, to prevent you from ever forgetting to undef the prefix,
you can use lexical prefix like this:

    prefix '/home' => sub {
      get '/page1' => sub {}; # will match '/home/page1'
    }; ## prefix reset to previous value on exit

    get '/page1' => sub {}; will match /page1

=head1 ACTION SKIPPING

An action can choose not to serve the current request and ask Dancer2 to process
the request with the next matching route.

This is done with the B<pass> keyword, like in the following example

    get '/say/:word' => sub {
        return pass if (params->{word} =~ /^\d+$/);
        "I say a word: ".params->{word};
    };

    get '/say/:number' => sub {
        "I say a number: ".params->{number};
    };


=head2 DEFAULT ERROR PAGES

When an error is rendered (the action responded with a status code different
than 200), Dancer2 first looks in the public directory for an HTML file matching
the error code (eg: 500.html or 404.html).

If such a file exists, it's used to render the error, otherwise, a default
error page will be rendered on the fly.

=head2 EXECUTION ERRORS

When an error occurs during the route execution, Dancer2 will render an error
page with the HTTP status code 500.

It's possible either to display the content of the error message or to hide it
with a generic error page.

This is a choice left to the end-user and can be set with the
B<show_errors> setting.

Note that you can also choose to consider all warnings in your route handlers
as errors when the setting B<warnings> is set to 1.

=head1 HOOKS

Hooks are code references (or anonymous subroutines) that are triggered at
specific moments during the resolution of a request.

Many of them are supported by the core but plugins and engines can also
define their own.

For documentation about all supported hooks, please refer to
L<Dancer2::Manual::Hooks>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENTS

Configuring a Dancer2 application can be done in many ways. The easiest one (and
maybe the dirtiest) is to put all your settings statements at the top of
your script, before calling the dance() method.

Other ways are possible.  You could write all your setting calls in the file
`appdir/config.yml'. You would, of course, have write the conffile in YAML.

While better than the first option, it's still not perfect.  You can't easily
switch from an environment to another (for example, from development to
production) without rewriting the config.yml file.  The best way is to have
one config.yml file with default global settings, like the following:

    # appdir/config.yml
    logger: 'file'
    layout: 'main'

And then write as many environment files as you like in appdir/environments.
That way, the appropriate environment config file will be loaded according to
the running environment (if none is specified, 'development' is assumed).

Note that you can change the running environment using the --environment
commandline switch.

Typically, you'll want to set the following values in a development config
file:

    # appdir/environments/development.yml
    log: 'debug'
    startup_info: 1
    show_errors:  1

And in a production one:

    # appdir/environments/production.yml
    log: 'warning'
    startup_info: 0
    show_errors:  0

Please note that you are not limited to writing configuration files in YAML.
Dancer2 supports any file format that is supported by L< Config::Any >, such as
JSON, XML, INI files, and Apache-style config files.

=head2 load

You can use the load method to include additional routes into your application:

    get '/go/:value', sub {
        # foo
    };

    load 'more_routes.pl';

    # then, in the file more_routes.pl:
    get '/yes', sub {
        'orly?';
    };

B<load> is just a wrapper for B<require>, but you can also specify a list of
routes files:

    load 'login_routes.pl', 'session_routes.pl', 'misc_routes.pl';

=head2 Accessing configuration data

A Dancer2 application can access the information from its config file easily with
the config keyword:

    get '/appname' => sub {
        return "This is " . config->{appname};
    };


=head1 Importing just the syntax

If you want to use more complex file hierarchies, you can import just the
syntax of Dancer2.

    package App;

    use Dancer2;            # App may contain generic routes
    use App::User::Routes; # user-related routes

Then in App/User/Routes.pm:

    use Dancer2 ':syntax';

    get '/user/view/:id' => sub {
        ...
    };

=head1 LOGGING

It's possible to log messages sent by the application. In the current version,
only one method is possible for logging messages but future releases may add
additional logging methods, for instance logging to syslog.

In order to enable the logging system for your application, you first have to
start the logger engine in your config file:

    logger: 'file'

Then you can choose which kind of messages you want to actually log:

    log: 'debug'     # will log debug, warning and errors
    log: 'warning'   # will log warning and errors
    log: 'error'     # will log only errors

A directory appdir/logs will be created and will host one logfile per
environment. The log message contains the time it was written, the PID of the
current process, the message and the caller information (file and line).

To log messages, use the debug, warning and error methods, for instance:

    debug "This is a debug message";


=head1 USING TEMPLATES

=head1 VIEWS

It's possible to render the action's content with a template; this is called a
view. The `appdir/views' directory is the place where views are located.

You can change this location by changing the setting 'views', for instance if
your templates are located in the 'templates' directory, do the following:

    set views => path(dirname(__FILE__), 'templates');

By default, the internal template engine is used (L<Dancer2::Template::Simple>)
but you may want to upgrade to Template::Toolkit. If you do so, you have to
enable this engine in your settings as explained in
L<Dancer2::Template::TemplateToolkit>. If you do so, you'll also have to import
the L<Template> module in your application code.

All views must have a '.tt' extension. This may change in the future.

In order to render a view, just call the 'template' keyword at the end of the
action by giving the view name and the HASHREF of tokens to interpolate in the
view (note that the request, session and route params are automatically
accessible in the view, named request, session and params):

    use Dancer2;
    use Template;

    get '/hello/:name' => sub {
        template 'hello' => { number => 42 };
    };

And the appdir/views/hello.tt view can contain the following code:

   <html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello [% params.name %]</h1>
        <p>Your lucky number is [% number %]</p>
        <p>You are using [% request.user_agent %]</p>
        [% IF session.user %]
            <p>You're logged in as [% session.user %]</p>
        [% END %]
    </body>
   </html>

=head2 LAYOUTS

A layout is a special view, located in the 'layouts' directory (inside the
views directory) which must have a token named `content'. That token marks the
place where to render the action view. This lets you define a global layout
for your actions. Any tokens that you defined when you called the 'template'
keyword are available in the layouts, as well as the standard session,
request, and params tokens. This allows you to insert per-page content into
the HTML boilerplate, such as page titles, current-page tags for navigation,
etc.

Here is an example of a layout: views/layouts/main.tt:

    <html>
        <head>[% page_title %]</head>
        <body>
        <div id="header">
        ...
        </div>

        <div id="content">
        [% content %]
        </div>

        </body>
    </html>

This layout can be used like the following:

    use Dancer2;
    set layout => 'main';

    get '/' => sub {
        template 'index' => { page_title => "Your website Homepage" };
    };

Of course, if a layout is set, it can also be disabled for a specific action,
like the following:

    use Dancer2;
    set layout => 'main';

    get '/nolayout' => sub {
        template 'some_ajax_view',
            { tokens_var => "42" },
            { layout => 0 };
    };

=head1 STATIC FILES

=head2 STATIC DIRECTORY

Static files are served from the ./public directory. You can specify a
different location by setting the 'public' option:

    set public => path(dirname(__FILE__), 'static');

Note that the public directory name is not included in the URL. A file
./public/css/style.css is made available as example.com/css/style.css.

=head2 STATIC FILE FROM A ROUTE HANDLER

It's possible for a route handler to send a static file, as follows:

    get '/download/*' => sub {
        my $params = shift;
        my ($file) = @{ $params->{splat} };

        send_file $file;
    };

Or even if you want your index page to be a plain old index.html file, just do:

    get '/' => sub {
        send_file '/index.html'
    };

=head1 SETTINGS

It's possible to change quite every parameter of the application via the
settings mechanism.

A setting is key/value pair assigned by the keyword B<set>:

    set setting_name => 'setting_value';

More usefully, settings can be defined in a configuration file.
Environment-specific settings can also be defined in environment-specific files
(for instance, you don't want auto_reload in production, and might want extra
logging in development).  See the cookbook for examples.

=head1 SERIALIZERS

When writing a webservice, data serialization/deserialization is a common issue
to deal with. Dancer2 can automatically handle that for you, via a serializer.

When setting up a serializer, a new behaviour is authorized for any route
handler you define: any non-scalar response will be rendered as a serialized
string, via the current serializer.

Here is an example of a route handler that will return a HashRef

    use Dancer2;
    set serializer => 'JSON';

    get '/user/:id/' => sub {
        { foo => 42,
          number => 100234,
          list => [qw(one two three)],
        }
    };

As soon as the content is not a scalar - and a serializer is set, which is not
the case by default - Dancer2 renders the response via the current
serializer.

Hence, with the JSON serializer set, the route handler above would result in a
content like the following:

    {"number":100234,"foo":42,"list":["one","two","three"]}

The following serializers are available, be aware they dynamically depend on
Perl modules you may not have on your system.

=over 4

=item B<JSON>

requires L<JSON>

=item B<YAML>

requires L<YAML>

=item B<XML>

requires L<XML::Simple>

=item B<Mutable>

will try to find the appropriate serializer using the B<Content-Type> and
B<Accept-type> header of the request.

=head1 EXAMPLE

This is a possible webapp created with Dancer2:

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    # make this script a webapp
    use Dancer2;

    # declare routes/actions
    get '/' => sub {
        "Hello World";
    };

    get '/hello/:name' => sub {
        "Hello ".param('name');
    };

    # run the webserver
    Dancer2->dance;
