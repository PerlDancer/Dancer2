=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role defines what servers need to implement and provide some helpful
attributes and methods for server implementations.

This role requires implementations that consume it to provide a C<name>
subroutine.

=attr host

Hostname to which the server will bind.

B<Required>.

=attr port

Port number to which the server will bind.

B<Required>.

=attr is_daemon

Boolean for whether the server should daemonize.

=attr apps

An arrayref to hold Dancer2 applications.

=attr dispatcher

A read/write attribute which holds the L<Dancer2::Core::Dispatcher> object, to
dispatch an incoming request to the appropriate route.

It has a lazy builder that creates a new dispatcher with the server's apps.

=attr postponed_hooks

Postponed hooks will be applied at the end, when the hookable objects are
instantiated, not before.

=method psgi_app

Returns a code reference of a proper PSGI reply to a dispatched request.

It dispatches the request using the dispatcher (and provides the environment
variables) and then calls C<to_psgi> and returns that reply wrapped in a code
reference.

Please review L<PSGI> for more details on the protocol and how it works.

=method register_application

Adds another application to the C<apps> attribute (see above).
