=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role is implemented by different
config readers. A config reader creates the
configuration for Dancer2 app.
Config can be created by reading configuration
files, from environment variables, by fetching
it from a cloud service, or any other means.

Default config reader is C<Dancer2::ConfigReader::Config::Any>
but user can create his own config reader
if he wants to replace or augment
the default method of config creation.
That method should implement this role.

The implementing module gets the following parameters
during creation:

=attr environment

The name of the environment used, e.g.
production, development, staging.

=attr location

The absolute path to the directory where the server started.

=attr default_config

A hash ref which contains the default values.

These arguments are passed when the object is created by
C<Dancer2::Core::App>.
ConfigReader then passes C<environment> and C<location> forward to every
config reader class when it instantiates them.
How the config reader applies them, depend on its needs.

Provides a C<config> attribute that - when accessing
the first time - feeds itself by finding and parsing
configuration files.

Also provides a C<setting()> method which is
supposed to be used by externals to
read/write config entries.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=attr location

Absolute path to the directory where the server started.

=attr config_location

Gets the location from the configuration. Same as C<< $object->location >>.

=attr environments_location

Gets the directory where the environment files are stored.

=attr config

Returns the whole configuration.

=attr environments

Returns the name of the environment.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 read_config

Load the configuration.
Whatever source the config comes from, files, env vars, etc.
