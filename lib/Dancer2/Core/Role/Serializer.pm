=head1 DESCRIPTION

Any class that consumes this role will be able to be used as a
serializer under Dancer2.

In order to implement this role, the consumer B<must> implement the
methods C<serialize> and C<deserialize>, and should define
the C<content_type> attribute value.

=head1 METHODS

=attr content_type

The I<content type> of the object after being serialized. For example,
a JSON serializer would have a I<application/json> content type
defined.

=method serialize($content, [\%options])

The serialize method need to be implemented by the consumer. It
receives the serializer class object and a reference to the object to
be serialized. Should return the object after being serialized, in the
content type defined by the C<content_type> attribute.

A third optional argument is a hash reference of options to the
serializer.

The serialize method must return bytes and therefore has to handle any
encoding.

=method deserialize($content, [\%options])

The inverse method of C<serialize>. Receives the serializer class
object and a string that should be deserialized. The method should
return a reference to the deserialized Perl data structure.

A third optional argument is a hash reference of options to the
serializer.

The deserialize method receives encoded bytes and must therefore
handle any decoding required.
