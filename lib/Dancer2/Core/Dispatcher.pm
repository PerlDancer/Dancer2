=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dancer2::Core::Dispatcher;

    # Create an instance of dispatcher
    my $dispatcher = Dancer2::Core::Dispatcher->new( apps => [$app] );

    # Dispatch a request
    my $resp = $dispatcher->dispatch($env)->to_psgi;

    # Capture internal error of a response (if any) after a dispatch
    $dispatcher->response_internal_error($app, $error);

    # Capture response not found for an application the after dispatch
    $dispatcher->response_not_found($env);

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 apps

The apps is an array reference to L<Dancer2::Core::App>.

=head2 default_content_type

The default_content_type is a string which represents the context of the
request. This attribute is read-only.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 dispatch

The C<dispatch> method accepts the list of applications, hash reference for
the B<env> attribute of L<Dancer2::Core::Request> and optionally the request
object and an env as input arguments.

C<dispatch> returns a response object of L<Dancer2::Core::Response>.

Any before hook and matched route code is wrapped using L<Return::MultiLevel>
to allow DSL keywords such as forward and redirect to short-circuit remaining code
without having to throw an exception. L<Return::MultiLevel> will use L<Scope::Upper>
(an XS module) if it is available.

=head2 response_internal_error

The C<response_internal_error> takes as input the list of applications and
a variable error and returns an object of L<Dancer2::Core::Error>.

=head2 response_not_found

The C<response_not_found> consumes as input the list of applications and an
object of type L<Dancer2::Core::App> and returns an object
L<Dancer2::Core::Error>.
