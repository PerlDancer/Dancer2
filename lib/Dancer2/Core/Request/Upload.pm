=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements a representation of file uploads for Dancer2.
These objects are accessible within route handlers via the request->uploads
keyword. See L<Dancer2::Core::Request> for details.


=attr filename

Filename as sent by client. optional. May not be undef.

=method my $filename=$upload->filename;

Returns the filename (full path) as sent by the client.

=attr tempname

The name of the temporary file the data has been saved to. Optional. May not be undef.

=method my $tempname=$upload->tempname;

Returns the name of the temporary file the data has been saved to.

For example, in directory /tmp, and given a random name, with no file extension.

=attr headers

A hash ref of the headers associated with this upload. optional. is read-write and a HashRef.

=method my $href=$upload->headers;

Returns a hashRef of the headers associated with this upload.

=attr size

The size of the upload, in bytes. Optional.

=method my $fh=$upload->file_handle;

Returns a read-only file handle on the temporary file.

=method $upload->copy_to('/path/to/target')

Copies the temporary file using File::Copy. Returns true for success,
false for failure.

=method $upload->link_to('/path/to/target');

Creates a hard link to the temporary file. Returns true for success,
false for failure.

=method my $content=$upload->content;

Returns a scalar containing the contents of the temporary file.

=method my $basename=$upload->basename;

Returns basename for "filename".

=method $upload->type

Returns the Content-Type of this upload.
