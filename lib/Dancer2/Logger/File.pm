=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a logging engine that allows you to save your logs to files on disk.

Logs are not automatically rotated.  Use a log rotation tool like
C<logrotate> in C<copytruncate> mode.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The setting C<logger> should be set to C<File> in order to use this logging
engine in a Dancer2 application.

The follow attributes are supported:

=for :list
* log_dir -- directory path to hold log files. Defaults to F<logs> in the application directory
* file_name -- the name of the log file. Defaults to the environment name with a F<.log> suffix

Here is an example configuration that use this logger and stores logs in F</var/log/myapp>:

  logger: "File"

  engines:
    logger:
      File:
        log_dir: "/var/log/myapp"
        file_name: "myapp.log"


=head1 METHODS

=method log($level, $message)

Writes the log message to the file.
