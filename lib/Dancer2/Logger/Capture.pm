# ABSTRACT: Capture dancer logs

package Dancer2::Logger::Capture;
use Moo;
use Dancer2::Logger::Capture::Trap;

with 'Dancer2::Core::Role::Logger';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The basics:

    set logger => "capture";

    my $trap = dancer_app->engine('logger')->trapper;
    my $logs = $trap->read;

A worked-out real-world example:

    use Test::More tests => 2;
    use Dancer2;

    set logger => 'capture';

    warning "Danger!  Warning!";
    debug   "I like pie.";

    my $trap = dancer_app->engine('logger')->trapper;

    is_deeply $trap->read, [
        { level => "warning", message => "Danger!  Warning!" },
        { level => "debug",   message => "I like pie.", }
    ];

    # each call to read cleans the trap
    is_deeply $trap->read, [];
