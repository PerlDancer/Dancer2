=head1 DESCRIPTION

The AutoPage feature is a Handler (turned off by default) that is
responsible for serving pages that match an existing template. If a
view exists with a name that matches the requested path, Dancer2
processes the request using the Autopage handler.

To turn it add to your config file:

      auto_page: 1

This allows you to easily serve simple pages without having to write a
route definition for them.

If there's no view with the name request, the route passes, allowing
other matching routes to be dispatched.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 register

Creates the routes.

=head2 code

A code reference that processes the route request.

=head2 methods

The methods that should be served for autopages.

Default: B<head>, B<get>.

=head2 regexp

The regexp (path) we want to match.

Default: B</:page>.
