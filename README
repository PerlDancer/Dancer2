This is the prototype for Dancer2

You can test it with:

  $ perl -Ilib ./contrib/test.pl

Also the progress of the DSL migration can be checked with ./progress.sh

And the test coverage ./cover.sh

*************** FEEDBACK WANTED ******************

The best way to help us with Dancer2 is to test it on existing real-life
applications.

You will certainly find something that doesnot work out-of-the box with this
prototype, then send a report to the email mailing list - dancer-users@dancer.pm
or the IRC channel - #dancer on irc.perl.org

Thanks.


*************** Progress *************************

Dancer 2.0 is at 90.00% ( 54 symbols supported on 60)
Dancer 2.0 code-lines ratio: 93.78% (11253/11999)

Dancer 2.0 DSL is missing: after, before, before_template, from_xml, load, to_xml
Dancer 2.0 DSL has these new keywords: app, context, core_debug, dancer_app, dancer_version, dancer_major_version, dsl, log, response, runner

Most of the plugins on CPAN might not be working as well, feedback welcome
again.
