                                    Dancer2 

               Lightweight yet powerful web application framework


Dancer2 is the new generation lightweight web-framework for Perl. It's a
complete rewrite of Dancer based on Moo.

An application can be as simple as this simple hello world script:

    use Dancer2;
    get '/' => sub { 
        "Hello World" 
    };
    dance;

Yes, you can use Dancer2 in production. It works.
